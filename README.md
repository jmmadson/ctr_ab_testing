# A/B Testing Click Through Rates

## Overview
This was an exercise to text the statistical significance of an A/B test run on website conversions. 

## Data Set
I used a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhangluyuan/ab-testing?resource=download)
for this practice. 

## Testing
This was a two-sample hypothesis test, that I used the Chi-Squared test to calculate the p-value and determine the rejection of the null hypothesis.
